Pretty lightweight web-app for cabin-booking's. 
The main page show available cabin's, and if you click a cabin, 
you'll be able to chose which dates you want to book. 
You can only choose available dates. The unavailable dates are unselectable. 


There's also a ADMIN-role preloaded in the database, as well as some pre-placed bookings of cabins.
To log in as an admin, go to Admin Login at the top of the page and type:

username: admin

password: ingetjidder123

As a logged in admin, you can see all the bookings in the Admin Page. 
## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```
